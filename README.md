# efrro_form_c_json

User iterface to enter data for e-frro and export it as json.

## chrome extension

This json is than used with the chrome extension chext_fill_form_from_json to fill the e-frro form C.  

## Goal

The hostel manager in India must fill the government online Form C for every guest. This is boring, time consuming and error prone.  
The guest should type his own data, but it is not practical to type it directly in the Form C, because this form is made for hostel managers.  
The best way is that the guest gives his data in some digital form (ex. json).  
The guest should type his data only once and use that same json for all the hostels.  
Json is just a text that can be easily copied. He can send it by email to the hostel manager.
